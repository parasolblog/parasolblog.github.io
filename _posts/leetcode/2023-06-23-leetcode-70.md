题目
---
ou are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?




Example 1
---
>Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1 step + 1 step + 1 step
1 step + 2 steps
2 steps + 1 step




Intuition

We can use DP to solve this problem.
* Base cases:
  1. if n<=0, number should return 0.
  2. if n==1, return 1, if n == 2 return 2.
  3. if we know the number ways to get n is (n-1) + (n-2). from n-1 we take one step, from n-2 we take two to get to n.


Solution

~~~ java
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        //each time 1 or 2 steps to reach n steps to top.
        // 2 state: 1 step or 2 step
        int [] dp = new int [n+1];
        if (n<=0){
            return 0;
        }
        if (n == 1){
            return 1;
        }
        if (n == 2){
            return 2;
        }
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp [1] = 1;
        dp [2] = 2;
        for (int i = 3; i<=n ; i++){
            dp [i] = dp [i-1] + dp[i-2];
        }
        return dp [n];
    }
}
